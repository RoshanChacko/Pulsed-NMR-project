# Probing molecular dynamics using pulsed nuclear magnetic resonance

This was my Year 3 Physics with Nanoscience project at the University of Nottingham, where I used T1 and T2 data from NMR spectrometry to explore the molecular dynamics of alcohols with varying chain lengths. The project report is Porject_102.pdf, and the experimental data and relvant code to process the data can be found in the branches. Below is the abstract for the project.

## Abstract
A bench-top NMR spectrometer based on the Red Pitaya microcomputer was used to
probe the molecular dynamics of 6 alcohol samples by obtaining their T1 and T2 values.
The pulse sequences used to obtain those values were the single echo spin echo pulse and
the inversion recovery pulse, respectively. The samples used were methanol, propan-1-ol,
glycerol, butan-1-ol, pentan-3-ol and decan-1-ol. The T1 times recorded were respectively
2460 ± 150 ms, 1542 ± 26 ms, 65 ± 2 ms, 1176 ± 72 ms, 603 ± 17 ms and 343 ± 4 ms. The
T2 times recorded were respectively 58 ± 10 ms, 39 ± 8 ms, 42 ± 1 ms, 28 ± 3 ms, 15 ± 2
ms and 9 ± 1 ms. It was noticed that as the carbon chain length increased, both T1 and T2
decreased in an exponential manner. Glycerol had the lowest T1 time however, and as seen,
this was due to it molecular structure instead of the carbon chain length. The report briefly
touches on correlation time and its relation to the results obtained above, and the room for
improvement for this experiment.
